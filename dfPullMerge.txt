Differences between git pull and git merge

1. git pull:
        It is used to update our local branch with changes from the corresponding remote branch. It is a shorthand command that performs two operations: git fetch followed by git merge.

        Syntax: git pull remoteorigin branch-name

        Example: git pull origin master

        Uses : 
         1. If there are new commits in both branches i.e our branch and the remote branch, git pull will automatically create a     merge commit to combine them.
         2. If there are conflicting changes, Git will notify us to resolve conflicts manually before completing the merge. 

2. git merge:
        It is used to integrate changes from one branch into another within your local repository. It combines the histories of the two branches by creating a new commit that includes changes from both branches.

        Syntax: git merge branch-name
                here the branch name is the branch that will be merged in the existing branch where the HEAD is pointing.
        
        Example: Suppose we are in main branch and we wan to merge a feature/addMessage branch to it. So, we will do the follwoing:
         git merge feature/addMessage

        Uses:
        1.To combine changes from different branches within the same repository.
